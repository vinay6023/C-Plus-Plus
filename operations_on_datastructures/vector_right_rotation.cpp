 *@brief  Rotates an 1D array/vector of length n by k indices in linear time.
 *
 *@details To obtain the desired vector in linear time complexity,lets place place every number
 *of the array at its desired correct position. But while doing this, we will lose the original elements.
 *Thus, we need to store the number being replaced in a 'temp' variable. Then, we can place the replaced
 *number(which is stored in temp) at its correct position and so on, n times, where n is the length of array.
 *We have chosen n to be the number of replacements since we have to shift all the elements of the array(which is n).
 *But, there could be a problem with this method, if n % k =0
 *where k = k%n (since a value of k larger than n eventually leads to a k equivalent to k%n). In this case,
 *while picking up numbers to be placed at the correct position, we will eventually reach the number from which
 *we originally started. Thus, in such a case, when we
 *hit the original number's index again, we start the same process with the index following our starting point.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *eg 1- say n=5,k=2
 *gcd(2,5)=1 (gcd=1 means all shifts an be done in one cycle)
 *a[0]->a[2] ; a[2]->a[4] ; a[4]->a[1] ;a[1]->a[3] ; a[3]->a[0] ;
 *eg 2- say n=6,k=2
 *gcd(2,6)=2 (gcd=2 means we need to have 2 cycles)
 *a[0]->a[2] ;a[2]->a[4] ;a[4]->a[0] ;
 *a[1]->a[3] ;a[3]->a[5] ;a[5]->a[1] ;
 *Note that-
 *the number of sub sequences are equal to the GCD of and k. If n and k are co-prime
 *complete process can be completed in one go as the subsequent indices are unique.
 *But if gcd>1 then the subsequent indices will repeat after n/gcd number of iterations,
 *hence we need to set our starting index in this case gcd number of times
